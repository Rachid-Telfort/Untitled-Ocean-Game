# Untitled-Ocean-Game

This game was part of my submission for the 2020 Global Game Jam.
This game was made in a span of three days as part of the time constriants of the jam.
For the jam I worked with 3 others who were tremendoulsy helpful! They were:
Guzal - Co Programmer
Jessica - Composer
AB - 3D Modeler

Overall I had fun and learned alot about using the Unity Engine and team work.
I hope that my fellow coders/programmers/developers find the information in this repository useful.

Finally, I would like to thank you for visiting my GitHub page it is much appreciated!
